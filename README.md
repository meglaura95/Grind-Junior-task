# Grind Junior Developer task

## Setup:
- Clone the repo.
- Make sure you have [node/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
- Install sass compiler `npm install -g sass`.

## Development:
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- To compile your SCSS into CSS, run `npm run build` in your terminal.

## Task:
- We would like you to write the JS and SCSS/CSS to show a specific person's details based off their ID.
- The user should enter a number into the input and click search, this will display the corresponding users details below.
- Some of the code has been written for you but feel free to change it if you want.
- The person data is coming from [jsonplaceholder](https://www.jsonplaceholder.org/). Read the docs to see how to retrieve specific user data.
- For the person thumbnail, just use a randomly generated image using this link `https://i.pravatar.cc/300`.
- Clean code is _key!_
- Refer to the screenshots below for how it should look.
